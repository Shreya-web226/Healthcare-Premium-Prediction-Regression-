In the current era of data-driven decision making, predicting health insurance premiums has become increasingly important for both insurance companies and policyholders. This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate health insurance premiums using regression techniques. By analyzing various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and medical history, this model will help insurance companies to accurately calculate premiums for their customers. The goal is to provide fair and customized premiums based on individual risk profiles while ensuring profitability and competitive pricing in the health insurance market.
